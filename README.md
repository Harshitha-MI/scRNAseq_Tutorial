# scRNAseq_Tutorial  

## Overview  
This repository contains an **R Markdown-based tutorial workflow** for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis.

**scRNA-seq** is a powerful technique that enables the profiling of gene expression at the resolution of individual cells, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity, development, and disease mechanisms. For a deeper introduction, see:  
üëâ [Single-cell transcriptomics: a review of applications and future perspectives (Haque et al., *Genome Medicine* 2017)](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4)

The workflow covers key steps such as:
- quality control (QC)
- normalization
- batch effect correction (using **Harmony**)
- clustering
- cell type annotation (using **SingleR**)

The tutorial guides users through a **reproducible scRNA-seq analysis pipeline**, built primarily with the **Seurat** package in R.

## About This Workflow  
I developed this tutorial to provide a clear, end-to-end, and reproducible scRNA-seq analysis pipeline. While the tools (Seurat, Harmony, SingleR) come from publicly available resources, this repository represents my effort to integrate, test, and document a cohesive workflow applied to real scRNA-seq data.

My goal is to support learning and reproducible research by offering a practical guide for students and researchers new to single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

## Data Source  
This tutorial uses data from:

**Luo L., Yang P., Mastoraki S., et al.**  
*Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies molecular biomarkers predicting late progression to CDK4/6 inhibition in patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.*  
*Molecular Cancer, 2025.*  
PMID: 39955556 | PMCID: PMC11829392 | DOI: [10.1186/s12943-025-02226-9](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12943-025-02226-9)

**GEO accession:** [GSE262288](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE262288)

Samples used:
- GSM8162620 ‚Äî Patient 3 ascites scRNA-seq sample 1
- GSM8162621 ‚Äî Patient 3 ascites scRNA-seq sample 2  

*Note: These samples are treated as biological replicates for this tutorial, regardless of their original experimental context.*

## Data Download  
‚ö† Due to file size limits, raw data matrices are **not included** in this repository.

üëâ Download the data directly from GEO:
- [GSM8162620](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8162620)
- [GSM8162621](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM8162621)

üí° Store each sample‚Äôs data in its own folder.  
Each folder should contain the following files (with exact names):
- `barcodes.tsv.gz`
- `features.tsv.gz`
- `matrix.mtx.gz`

‚û° Ensure the file names match these conventions so the tutorial script can read them correctly. Update the file paths in `tutorial.Rmd` if your folder structure differs.
